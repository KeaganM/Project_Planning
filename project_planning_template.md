##Summary
- Think of this as an abstract, typically encompasses everything we discuss here in a few sentences.
- a small summary detailing the problem, the desired solution, maybe some background infromation,
projected timeline, main tool used, and minimum functionality. 

##Background
- Any background information, links to documentation, scripts, resources etc. 

##Problem
- Specify the problem and a desired solution or output. 
- Reiterate the problem and the desired solution.

##Code

###Language and Libraries
- List or table that shows the list of programming languages, libraries, tools used

###Functionality

####Minimum Features/Entities
- List or table of the minimum required features/entities (classes) required to get the 
solution 

#####Program Architecture
- May want to use an activity diagram, class diagrams, etc. 


#####Program Pseudocode
- A series of bullet points going over the process, may be reiterating a bit of 
the program architecture section

####Other Features/Entities
- A section that you can list off useful functions, classes, mainly quality of life 
pieces of functionality that shouldn't be required for the program to fulfill its 
goal. 

###Interface
- The type of interface that is going to be used; something detailing how the client

- This can be a description of the interface, somthing like a terminal/command prompt is used 
or a main fucntion that accepts a config file, gui, webapp, etc.
