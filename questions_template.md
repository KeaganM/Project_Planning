##General Questions
- (What) Reiterate your understanding of the problem and confirm that it aligns with the clients issue. For example: 
<b>the purpose of this project is to create a web-application with a user-friendly interface to allow a local database
to be queried; upon success, returning a set of results that can be downloaded, is that correct?</b>

- (When) is a final product or working version desired?

- (Who) is this project for (programming, user, etc..)? 

- What are the expected deliverables?

- What kind of interface is desired? Some options may include:
  - Simple (may not be very user-friendly) 
    - terminal/command prompt
    - config file/data directory and main function
    - script with public function/class
  - Advanced (more user-friendly)
    - website/web-application (front-end)
    - simple GUI made in tkinter,PyQT, Kivy, etc...

- Are there any restrictions in terms of tools, languages, libraries that are in place? Will any 3rd-party
libraries be allowed or only a select few; will this have to be done using vanilla libraries?
